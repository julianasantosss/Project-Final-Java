Practical workshop, final project POO

## Description
This Object Oriented Programming (OOP) workshop consists of two projects: student management and geometric figure management.

## Project 1: Student Management
Application that allows adding, searching, updating and deleting students in a list. Each student has a name, unique ID number and grade.

## Project 2: Geometric Figures Management
System that allows to create geometric figures (circles, rectangles, triangles) and calculate their area, perimeter, move and rotate them in a plane.

## Main functionalities
- Add Students**: Validation of unique IDs.
- Figure Management**: Calculation of area and perimeter, movement and rotation of figures.
- Interactive Menu**: Allows to interact with both applications.

## Requirements
